# SiVi - SImple VI (in progress)  
SiVi is an open-source, lightweight text editor made in the Rust programming language  
It is part of my DofE bronze skills section  
You can run it using the sivi run file  
Currently, it is not functional, and only has the mini file explorer  
When the first functional release comes, a mini-tutorial will be added
